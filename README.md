# Newborn DNA Simulator

A C# application that simulates DNA sequence manipulation and BLOB (Binary Large OBject) organism generations. This project provides various DNA operations and analysis tools.

## ðŸ§¬ Features

### DNA Loading Options
1. Load from file
2. Load from string input
3. Generate random BLOB DNA sequence

### DNA Operations
1. **Check DNA Structure** (Operation 4)
   - Validates gene structure
   - Checks codon sequences
   - Verifies start and stop codons

2. **BLOB DNA Verification** (Operation 5)
   - Validates BLOB-specific requirements
   - Checks gender markers
   - Verifies gene count

3. **DNA Manipulation**
   - Generate DNA complement (Operation 6)
   - Delete codons (Operation 8)
   - Insert codons (Operation 9)
   - Find codons (Operation 10)
   - Reverse codons (Operation 11)

4. **DNA Analysis**
   - Count genes (Operation 12)
   - Find shortest gene (Operation 13)
   - Find longest gene (Operation 14)
   - Find most repeated sequences (Operation 15)
   - Calculate hydrogen bond statistics (Operation 16)

5. **BLOB Generation Simulation** (Operation 17)
   - Simulates BLOB reproduction
   - Handles gene inheritance
   - Tracks generation health
